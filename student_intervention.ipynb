    "\n",
    "1. Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "A random forest classifier is a method that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and use averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. It is easy to use, has great computational efficiency, and improves overfitting issue than regular decision trees. It is very flexible, can be used in a wide range of applications, such as credit assessment (Shi, 2011; Ghatasheh, 2014), machinery fault diagnosis (Yan, 2006; Han, 2006), face recognition (Ghoshal, 2009), prediction of aquatic toxicity (Polishchuk, 2009) and so on. There are also some weaknesses. A random forest usually is hard to provide comprehensible results, as the results are not quite interpretable. It is hard to make incremental. Whenever a new instance is added, there is no algorithm to easily add it into the model. A random forest outputs discrete results. When variables are continuous and highly linear, the model may not give a ideal output. Because this dataset has multiple discrete features, and the results are in binary categories, a random forest classifier can fit in this situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of SVMs are the use of kernels, the absence of local minima, the sparseness of the solution and the capacity control obtained by optimizing the margin (Shawe-Taylor, 2004). By introducing the kernels, SVMs have flexibility to separate the data, either linear or nonlinear. It has a convex optimization problem (no local minima), therefore more robust compared to the neutral network. SVMs are not good for large dataset, since the training time is scaled to be cubic in the size of the dataset. The required physical memory is also cubic scaled increasing along with data size in both training and testing. The performance of SVMs is highly depend on the selection of kernels and parameters such as C and gamma. It may runs very slow due to iteration and convergence problems. SVMs were originally developed for pattern recognition problems (Schmidt 1996; Joachims, 1998), but it has been extensively used in financial time series forecasting (Tay, 2001; Cao, 2003; Miuller, 2000; Yang, 2004 etc.). This dataset is small (only 395 samples) therefore a support vector machine can be a good candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of training is zero for a k-nearest neighbors classifier, so it is effective if the training data is large. It is also robust to noisy training data. No assumptions about the characteristic of features has to be made. The drawbacks are the expensive computational cost of prediction with large dataset, the lack of interpretability for the model, the high sensitivity to parameters (number of nearest neighbors and type of distance), and the high dependence on dimensions (curse of dimensionality) of performance. KNNs have been used in financial and economical events prediction (Imandoust, 2013), image classification (Li, 2009), pharmacogenomical analysis and prediction (Parry, 2010), text and document mining (Bijalwan, 2014) and so on. This dataset is small, and it is hard to make assumptions from the features, so k-nearest neighbors classifier can be tried."

Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
    "**Note:** Three tables are provided after the following code cell which can be used to store your results."

This SVM model has the highest prediction F<sub>1</sub> score among all three models. Even though it has a longer computational time than random forest classifiers, it has 10% higher F<sub>1</sub> score than random forest. This SVM has generally shorter computational time and better F<sub>1</sub> score than the k-nearest neighbors. By fine-tuning parameters, SVMs should have better performance and prediction accuracy. Considering relatively small quantity of data for this student intervention project, the computational time wouldn't be significant for this dataset. For this case, precision and accuracy are the dominant factors. In summary, SVMs are generally the most appropriate model based on available data, limited resources, cost, and performance."

    "Support vector machines (SVM) are linear separators which can separator data into two categories by a straight line. For a two-dimensional case, data are plotted in a coordinate system along the x-and y-axes. SVMs will draw a straight line to separate these data into two categories. In order to keep the model validated and effective whenever new data being added into existing dataset, the separation line will be selected at the middle of two categorical boundaries where the distance to each categorical boundary is maximum. This is called maximum margin. This is so that new instances are most likely to be classified correctly. The categorical boundaries are called support lines, and they are paralleled to the separation line. Support lines are only determined by data which are on the boundaries, and only these data instances closest to the support lines matter. These data are called support vectors (see **Graph A**), from which support vector machines get the name. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes on a two-dimensional coordinate the data are distributed like **Graph B** shown. In such case a straight line seems can’t separate data into two categories. A transformation called kernel trick can be made here. The third axis can be implemented as z = x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>, therefore the original two-dimensional problem is transformed to a three-dimensional problem, and all the data will be mapped into a three-dimensional space. If we look at the three-dimensional space shown as **Graph C**, in which z = x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> is the horizontal axis and y is the vertical axis, all the data can be separated by a straight linear line (here in three-dimensional space it is actually called a hyperplane) with maximum margin just as what has been done in two-dimensional space. Here x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> is our kernel function.\n",
